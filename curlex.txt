You need to set your content-type to application/json. But -d sends the Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which is not accepted on Spring's side.

Looking at the curl man page, I think you can use -H:

-H "Content-Type: application/json"
Full example:

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"id":1511}' \
  http://localhost:8080/user
